QuizGen
=======

QuizGen is a small weekend project made to generated quizzes for a small community I roam in, it'll generate a valid JSON file for the IRC Bot to use. As it is a weekend project, the code is very simple, and not very scalable.

QuizGen is hosted on [quiz.zarth.us](http://quiz.zarth.us).

QuizGen is licensed under the MIT license, and makes use of bootstrap and the css of htmlboilerplate.
